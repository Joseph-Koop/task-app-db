The web app displays a list of tasks for the user. The user can add tasks, mark tasks as completed or pending, and delete tasks. They can also search for a task by its title, filter tasks by completion status, or sort tasks by id or priority level.

To add a new task, click the add button on the top left. This will display a form. Fill in the title and description, choose a priority level, and click submit. The form will close and you will see the new task on the list.

To change the completion status of a task, click the green checkmark on the right side of the task. This will switch the status, either striking it out if complete or removing the strike from it if changed back to pending.

To delete a task, click the delete icon next to the green checkmark. This will remove the task from the list.

To sort or filter, simply change the option currently selected in the sort or filter bar. To search for a task, enter part of the title in the search bar, click search, and all matching tasks will be highlighted in yellow.
